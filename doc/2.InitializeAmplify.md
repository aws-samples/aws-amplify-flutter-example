# Initialize Amplify

1. [Install the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/)

2. Initialize Amplify Project

   ```bash
   # cd path/to/your/project
   âžœ  PowerToolkit git:(master) amplify init
   Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
   ? Enter a name for the project PowerToolkit
   The following configuration will be applied:
   
   Project information
   | Name: PowerToolkit
   | Environment: dev
   | Default editor: Visual Studio Code
   | App type: flutter
   | Configuration file location: ./lib/
   
   ? Initialize the project with the above configuration? No
   ? Enter a name for the environment dev
   ? Choose your default editor: Android Studio
   ? Choose the type of app that you're building flutter
   Please tell us about your project
   ? Where do you want to store your configuration file? ./lib/
   Using default provider  awscloudformation
   ? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
   
   For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html
   
   ? Please choose the profile you want to use default
   ```

3. Add amplify dependencies in pubspec.yaml, then execute ```$ flutter pub get```.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
   
     amplify_core: ^0.4.5
     amplify_flutter: ^0.4.5
     amplify_auth_cognito: ^0.4.5
     amplify_storage_s3: ^0.4.5
     amplify_analytics_pinpoint: ^0.4.5
     amplify_api: ^0.4.5
   
     # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
     # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
     cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
   ```

4. For iOS, open Podfile (iOS > Podfile), update the platform of ios to '11.0' or higher

   ```shell
   # Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
   platform :ios, '11.0'
   ```

5. For Android, open local.properties (android > local.properties), update SdkVersion as below:

   ```properties
   flutter.minSdkVersion=21
   flutter.targetSdkVersion=30
   flutter.compileSdkVersion=30
   ```

   Notice: For the version (2.13.0-0.0.pre.965) of flutter, [build.gradle defaultConfig with local.properties not working properly](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/95533), so the configuration in the build.gradle (android > app > build.gradle) file needs to be set manually.

   ```
   //      minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion
           minSdkVersion 21
   ```

6. Run the project for test.
